## Welcome!


I am an aspiring AI/ML Engineer pursuing a BSc in Computer Science at the University of London. I am interested in Machine Learning research and topics ranging from the empirical theory of deep learning, AI safety and AI alignment, where I explore ways to enhance alignment schemes and gain deeper insights into ML systems. I am also exploring what I can do within the effective altruism community. My interests extend to Natural Language Processing (NLP), Generative AI,  and Reinforcement learning. 
I will be posting each of my projects here as I complete them and also write about non-research stuff.
Thanks for stoping by!

## Highlighted Projects

<h4>Highlighted Projects</h4>

<b>Title:</b> [AYA: An Open Sciene Initiative to Accelerate Multilingual Progress](https://cohere.com/research/aya)<br> <b><u>Role: Independent Researcher (Aya Language Ambassador)</u></b> <br>As one of the quality champions of the AYA dataset, I lead the way in ensuring the textual data contributed to Aya was of high quality including being free of grammatical errors, safe and
factually correct, and robust completions to support model training. As a language Ambassador, I helped spread the word about Aya, recruit new contributors, support those contributors to understand
the goals of Aya data collection efforts, and celebrate progress.

<b>Project:</b> [Aya Dataset](https://cohere.com/research/papers/aya-dataset-paper-2024-02-13) ,  [Aya Journey and Report](https://cohere.com/research/aya/aya-at-a-glance.pdf) ![](images/Ayac){width="700"}
[Verify Credential](https://credsverse.com/credentials/932e7f99-38cd-43a8-894c-19a8ccceec68?preview=1)

<U><b>Description:</b></U>
The Aya project is the largest participatory research initiative to date, changing how breakthroughs happen. The research involved 3K independent collaborators across 119 countries, making this the largest open science project to date in the field of machine learning. 
C4AI is open-sourcing this work to unlock AI research on a global scale. Aya will be made available to the research community to further advance this critical effort. The work provides AI researchers with a first-of-its-kind foundation to support multilingual AI research projects.
