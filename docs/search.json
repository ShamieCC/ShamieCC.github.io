    "text": "Welcome!EducationHighlighted Projects\n\n\nI am an aspiring AI/ML Engineer pursuing a BSc in Computer Science at the University of London. I am interested in Machine Learning research and topics ranging from the empirical theory of deep learning, AI safety and AI alignment, where I explore ways to enhance alignment schemes and gain deeper insights into ML systems. I am also exploring what I can do within the effective altruism community. My interests extend to Natural Language Processing (NLP), Generative AI, and Reinforcement learning. I will be posting each of my projects here as I complete them and also write about non-research stuff. Thanks for stoping by!\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n University of London (UoL)Bachelor of Science in Computer Science | 2021 - 2025  Specialization: Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence  Activities: Student Blogger Highlighted Blog \n\n\n\nHighlighted Projects\n\nTitle: AYA: An Open Science Initiative to Accelerate Multilingual Progress Role: Independent Researcher (Aya Language Ambassador) As one of the quality champions of the AYA dataset, I lead the way in ensuring the textual data contributed to Aya was of high quality including being free of grammatical errors, safe and factually correct, and robust completions to support model training. As a language Ambassador, I helped spread the word about Aya, recruit new contributors, support those contributors to understand the goals of Aya data collection efforts, and celebrate progress.\nProject: Aya Dataset , Aya Journey and Report  Verify Credential\nDescription: The Aya project is the largest participatory research initiative to date, changing how breakthroughs happen. The research involved 3K independent collaborators across 119 countries, making this the largest open science project to date in the field of machine learning. C4AI is open-sourcing this work to unlock AI research on a global scale. Aya will be made available to the research community to further advance this critical effort. The work provides AI researchers with a first-of-its-kind foundation to support multilingual AI research projects."

    "text": "Pick a paper. Implementing a paper can take a lot of time and can often be frustrating, so as you are starting out, choose a paper that has existing implementation so that you can cross reference your work. Another reason to do this is, details are often missing from a paper, they are forgotten, or it is assumed you know, or they are somewhere in the code, or you would have to look at reference papers to see the details."

What happens when we can’t find the details?…\nAt times you would have to reach out to the authors to see if they are available over twitter or email, to help answer some questions.\nIdentify paper idea, how the authors implement and test it. The most effective way to read a paper is to read in passes, that is read it multiple times with increasing levels of detail. it is not advised to read from top to bottom line by line. With subsequent readings, you will be able to fill in more of the details as you go. So the first pass you can read the abstract, look at the diagrams which usually detail the architecture of the model, and then the results. In later passes you can read more of the introduction, architecture details, experimenent details and other information in the paper to deepen your understanding."
